# Image2sketch
To create pencil sketch from an image using python.

This Python code takes an input image and converts it into a pencil sketch. It achieves this by first converting the image to grayscale and then inverting the grayscale image to create a negative version. After applying a Gaussian blur to the negative grayscale image, it combines it with the original grayscale image to produce the final pencil sketch. The resulting sketch is then saved as an output image.
